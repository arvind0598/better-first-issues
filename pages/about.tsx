                Better First Issues targets developers who want to contribute to open-source
                software but do not know where or how to start.Github does provide its own
                advanced search, but I have always found it too convoluted to use.

                select issues and repositories based on programming languages that they are
                comfortable with. In addition, they can choose the type of issues they want
